            However, her tenure was not without controversy.
            In 1975, Indira Gandhi declared a state of emergency,
            suspending civil liberties and imposing strict censorship. 
            This period was marked by allegations of human rights abuses and political repression. 
            The emergency lasted for 21 months before being lifted in 1977.

            Tragically, Indira Gandhi's political journey came to an abrupt end when she was assassinated on October 31, 1984, 
            by her own bodyguards at her residence in New Delhi. Her assassination led to widespread political turmoil and 
            violence across the country.

            Despite the controversies and challenges she faced, Indira Gandhi's legacy continues to be significant in Indian politics.
            She was a trailblazing female leader who shattered barriers, 
            serving as an inspiration for women in India and around the world.
            Her contributions to India's development, her advocacy for social justice, 
            and her influential role in shaping the country's foreign policy make her an enduring figure in Indian history.
